# rootkit

This is the repo for the rootkits I develop for my something awesome project for COMP6841. 
They run on FreeBSD 12 and require you to have the source code available. Like everything only install these modules on systems you have permission to use! Ideally run these in a virtual machine, or in an environment where there's no consequences if everything fails.

Everything I've worked on here is strictly for educational purposes.
